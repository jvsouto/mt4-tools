The included web server configuration uses SSL certificates which must be located in this directory. You may put/symlink your
own certificates here or you may use the self-signed certificates in the subdirectory `self-signed`. Either way the
Apache configuration expects the files to be named `www.rosasurfer.com.crt` and `www.rosasurfer.com.key`.
